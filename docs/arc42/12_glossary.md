| AA       | amino acid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| aligned  | a nucleotide sequence is aligned, if it is arranged such that it has many similarities to a given reference genome. The aligned sequence has the same length as the reference genome. Gaps are marked in the aligned sequence. Insertions are stored separately. |
| QC       | quality control; in our case, it usually refers to the quality checks and metrics of the sequences, targeting how well the nucleotide sequence was determined from the probe.                                                                                    |
| Variant  | We follow a very open definition of variants. Every subset of sequences is considered a variant. A variant is specified by lineage/clade names and mutations. A variant does not need to be [monophyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyly).             |
