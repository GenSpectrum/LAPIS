# Architecture Constraints

We identified the following constrains for our software:
- developed under an open-source licence
- versioned by git
- input files in a specific format:
  - metadata and quality control
  - sequence data (non-aligned nucleotide sequences, aligned nucleotide sequences, aligned AA sequences )
  - reference genome
- usable only for virus species (bacteria might not work, why?)
- run on Linux, and MacOS, with at least (constraints RAM, HDD, etc.?, cloud?)
