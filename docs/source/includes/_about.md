LAPIS is being developed and maintained in the [Computational Evolution group of ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cevo) in Switzerland bsse.ethz.ch/cevo (Chaoran Chen and Tanja Stadler). The monkeypox data is pre-processed and aligned by members of the [NextStrain team](https://nextstrain.org/). We acknowledge the teams around the world sharing data openly on genbank in real time during this outbreak. We express our sincere gratitude.
