| Term     | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| AA       | amino acid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| aligned  | a nucleotide sequence is aligned, if it is arranged such that it has many similarities to a given reference genome. The aligned sequence has the same length as the reference genome. Gaps are marked in the aligned sequence. Insertions are stored separately. |
| Mutation | a divergence from the reference genome (see below).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Organism | The organism that the genomic data was extracted from. Each LAPIS instance serves data for a single organism.                                                                                                                                                    |
| QC       | quality control; in our case, it usually refers to the quality checks and metrics of the sequences, targeting how well the nucleotide sequence was determined from the probe.                                                                                    |
| Segment  | The genome of an organism may consist of multiple nucleotide sequence pieces. We call those pieces "segments".                                                                                                                                                   |
| Variant  | We follow a very open definition of variants. Every subset of sequences is considered a variant. A variant is specified by lineage/clade names and mutations. A variant does not need to be [monophyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyly).             |

## Mutations

Mutations can occur either on nucleotide level or on amino acid level.
For the nucleotides a single symbol can produce a mutation, whereas for the amino acids,
some nucleotide mutations still produce the same amino acid
([see also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables)).

The following explains the notations for mutations.

### Amino Acid Mutations

The gene has to be provided for the AA mutation, since AAs only make sense within a gene.

**Example ORF_1a\:G1234S**. This translates to

-   in Gene: ORF_1a
-   AA mutation from "G" to "S" at position 1234

The origin AA symbol can be omitted, since it is clear from the reference genome.
**Example: ORF_1a:1234S**

### Nucleotide Mutations

**Example: C1234T**. This translates to

-   a nucleotide mutation from nucleotide "C"
-   at position 1234 in the genome
-   to nucleotide "T"

The origin nucleotide symbol can be omitted, since it is clear from the reference genome.
**Example: 1234T**

If the organism has multiple nucleotide sequence segments, the segment has to be provided.
**Example: segment_name\:C1234T**
