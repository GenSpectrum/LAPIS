title: Introduction and Goals
description: Introduction to the architecture and the developers docs of LAPIS
---

This document was inspired by the [arc42 template](https://arc42.org/).

It describes LAPIS (**L**ightweight **API** for **S**equences),
which is a platform to give easy access to genomic sequence data alongside metadata of the sequenced probes.
It is used to filter potentially large sequence data and return the result to the user through web access,
so that a user can develop their own evaluation of the data.

The initial implementation of LAPIS is specialized for SARS-CoV-2 and is used
by [CoV-Spectrum](https://cov-spectrum.org).
In this approach, we want to develop a generalized API that is configurable for a wider range of organisms.
The solution consists of two systems, LAPIS and SILO, which are designed to work together,
but they could be operated independently of each other.
SILO serves as a database with a specialized query language (SILO queries),
which could in principle be exchanged by any other database.

This document focuses on LAPIS, but we usually think of it as operated as a single unit with SILO.
We refer to this special configuration as SILO-LAPIS.

The following goals have been established for this system:

| Priority |                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Provide an API to query large sets of genomic sequence data in a very efficient way.                        |
| 2        | Provide the infrastructure such that other researchers ("maintainers") can easily setup their own instance. |

| Provide statistics                      | Provide monitoring and statistics of usage of the system.                        |

## Quality Goals

|                        | Ease of learning | The queries should be as easy to write as possible. We provide material to assist in learning the query language. |

|                        |                  |                                                                                                                   |
