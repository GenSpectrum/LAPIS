title: Architecture and Constraints
description: Overview of the architecture and constraints of the software.
---

We identified the following constraints for our software:

-   Developed under an open-source licence. We chose the tooling such that a broad spectrum of developers can in principle
    work on the software.
-   The software is designed to be highly configurable so that it can be used for various organisms.
    Configuration files have to be passed to LAPIS and SILO at runtime that determine the nature of the organism such as:
    -   a reference genome
    -   which metadata is available on the genomic data
-   Input files for SILO are provided in a specific format:
    -   metadata and quality control
    -   sequence data (non-aligned nucleotide sequences, aligned nucleotide sequences, aligned AA sequences)
    -   a Pango lineage alias map (if available for the organism)
-   LAPIS is backed by a database that understands SILO queries.
-   The system is designed to have the best possible performance.
    This mostly targets SILO, but also in LAPIS,
    we have to keep in mind that we are dealing with potentially large data that we have to serve to the client.
