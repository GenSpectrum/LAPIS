It is possible to filter for amino acid and nucleotide bases/mutations.
Multiple mutation filters can be provided in a single request.

<NucleotideMutations />

An amino acid mutation has the format `<gene>:<position><base>`. <GeneNames />
A `<base>` can be one of the 20 amino acid codes.
It can also be `-` for deletion and `X` for unknown. **Example:** <AminoAcidMutationExample />

The `<base>` can be omitted to filter for any mutation.
You can write a `.` for the `<base>` to filter for sequences for which it is confirmed that no mutation occurred,
i.e. has the same base as the reference genome at the specified position.

:::note
Both, nucleotide and amino acid mutation filter, also support `Maybe` queries.

**Example:** <MaybeAminoAcidMutationExample/>.
