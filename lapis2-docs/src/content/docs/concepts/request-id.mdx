LAPIS uses a request id to identify requests.
This is useful for debugging and logging purposes.

:::note
If you report an error that occurred in LAPIS, please include the request id.
This will greatly simplify identifying the problem in our log files.
:::

You can provide a request id in the request as an HTTP header `X-Request-Id`.
This is useful if you want to correlate requests in your own log files with the LAPIS log files
to track problems across systems, e.g. if your own API calls LAPIS.

:::caution
If you use the `X-Request-Id` header, make sure that the value is unique.
:::

If you don't specify a request id, LAPIS will generate one for you.
It is contained in the response header `X-Request-Id` and in `info` in the response body.
