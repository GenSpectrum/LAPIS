description: LAPIS' caching concept

import CacheSizeEndpointLink from '../../../../components/CacheSizeEndpointLink.astro';

LAPIS uses Spring Boot's caching capabilities to cache insertion and mutation queries.
We decided to cache SILO actions that are relatively expensive to compute,
but don't return much data (measured in size of the response body).

At the time of writing, we think that aggregated queries are fast enough to not require caching.
Details and FASTA actions are more expensive, but return potentially large amounts of data.

LAPIS offers an endpoint to check the current cache size (in number of cached entries) at `/actuator/metrics/cache.size`:

<CacheSizeEndpointLink />
