This section covers the basics of using LAPIS.

## Endpoints

LAPIS is accessible through various endpoints, each serving a distinct purpose and returning different data.
For instance, the `GET /sample/aggregated` endpoint returns the count of sequences that meet specified filter criteria.
Every endpoint accepts [`GET` and `POST`](/concepts/request-methods) requests.
Both methods yield identical data; however, the manner of providing the filter criteria differs.

The various endpoints are listed in the [Open API / Swagger](/references/open-api-definition/) documentation,
which also offers a convenient testing interface via Swagger-UI.

## Filters

The output from each endpoint can be refined using various parameters.
For instance, to determine the number of sequences originating from Germany,
you would use `GET /sample/aggregated?country=Germany`.
The available filters are detailed in [Filters](/references/filters/),
and you can experiment with them at [Open API / Swagger](/references/open-api-definition/).

## Fields

Fields allow you to dictate the grouping of the returned data.
For example, to find out the number of sequences from each country,you would use `GET /sample/aggregated?fields=country`.
The available fields are documented in [Fields](/references/fields/),
and you can test them at [Open API / Swagger](/references/open-api-definition/).
