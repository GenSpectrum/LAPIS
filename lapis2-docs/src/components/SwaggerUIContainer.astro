<p>
    An <a href='https://www.openapis.org/'>OpenAPI specification</a> is a formal (human and computer readable) description
    of an API, like LAPIS. You can find the specification of this LAPIS instance here: <a href={openApiUrl}
        >{openApiUrl}</a
    >.
</p>
<h2>Swagger UI</h2>
<p>
    A Swagger UI is an interactive UI generated from the OpenAPI specification. You can find LAPIS' Swagger UI included
    below or behind this link: <a href={swaggerUiUrl}>{swaggerUiUrl}</a>. It shows all available endpoints and allows
    you to try them out. Just click on the "Try it out" button. You can set the filters, fields to group by and the
    response format.
</p>
<p>
    The Swagger UI also provides the possible responses for each endpoint, sorted by the <a
        href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes'>response codes</a
    >. In general, a response of 200 means that the request was successful and it returns the requested data. For json
    responses, example data is provided. Additionally, if you want to know more about the response and its fields, you
    can click on 'Schema', next to 'Example Value', and navigate through the tree of fields.
