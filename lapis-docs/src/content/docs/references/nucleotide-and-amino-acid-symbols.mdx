title: Nucleotide And Amino Acid Symbols
description: A reference list of valid symbols
---

This page lists valid symbols for nucleotides and amino acids.

## Usage in Mutations

All symbols listed below (including ambiguity codes) can be used in both the "from" and "to" positions of mutation queries.

**Examples:**
- `A123T` - Standard nucleotide mutation from adenine to thymine at position 123
- `N123T` - Mutation from any nucleotide (N) to thymine at position 123
- `S:X501Y` - Amino acid mutation from any amino acid (X) to tyrosine at position 501 in gene S
- `S:N501Y` - Amino acid mutation from asparagine to tyrosine at position 501 in gene S

This applies to all query types, including standard filters, variant queries, and advanced queries.
