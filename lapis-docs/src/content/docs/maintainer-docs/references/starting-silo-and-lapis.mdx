shows an example step by step.

## Starting SILO

SILO can be started in two modes:

-   `preprocessing`: Starts the SILO preprocessing that prepares the data for the SILO API server.
-   `api`: Starts the SILO API server that responds to SILO queries.

We provide Docker images for SILO with the name: `ghcr.io/genspectrum/lapis-silo`.
Those images can be used to start SILO in both modes.

### Starting the SILO preprocessing

To start the SILO preprocessing you need to provide the argument `--preprocessing`.
SILO will then start reading the input data, process it
and terminate after the result is written to the output directory.

Optionally, you can specify:

-   `--preprocessingConfig`:
    The path to the [preprocessing config](../references/preprocessing#preprocessing-config) file that SILO should use,
    e.g. `~/LAPIS/preprocessing_config.yaml`
-   `--databaseConfig`:
    The path to the [database config](../references/database-configuration) file that SILO should use,
    e.g. `~/LAPIS/database_config.yaml`.

If those parameters are not provided, SILO will try to read the files from its current working directory.
See the [preprocessing reference](../references/preprocessing#preprocessing-config)
for how to provide the input files.

#### Starting the SILO preprocessing with Docker

You only have to pass the argument `--preprocessing` to the Docker container.
The image is constructed with defaults in a way that you only need to mount the data to the correct locations:

-   the preprocessing config to `/app/preprocessing_config.yaml`,
-   the database config to `/app/database_config.yaml`,
-   the data to `/preprocessing/input`,
-   the output directory to `/preprocessing/output`.

### Starting the SILO API

To start the SILO API server you need to provide the argument `--api`.
It will start a web server that listens to port 8081.

The SILO API will read data from a directory that can be specified (in descending order of prevalence) via:

-   a program argument `--dataDirectory`,
-   YAML file `./runtime_config.yaml` (in SILO's working directory) with the key `dataDirectory`,
-   the default value `./output/` (in SILO's working directory).

The database config does not need to be provided.
It is contained in the compiled output of the preprocessing.

#### Starting the SILO API with Docker

You only have to pass the argument `--api` to the Docker container.
The image is constructed with a runtime config file that sets the data directory to `/data`,
i.e. you only need to mount the result of the preprocessing to `/data`.

## Starting LAPIS

To start LAPIS you need to provide the following parameters:

-   `--silo.url`: The URL where SILO is running, e.g. `http://localhost:8081`.
-   `--lapis.databaseConfig.path`:
    The path to the [database config](../references/database-configuration) file that LAPIS should use,
    e.g. `~/LAPIS/database_config.yaml`.
-   `--referenceGenomeFilename`:
    The path to the [reference genomes](../references/reference-genomes) file that LAPIS should use,
    e.g. `~/reference_genomes.json`.
    This can alternatively be passed via the environment variable `REFERENCE_GENOME_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME`.
    The parameter takes precedence over the environment variable.

LAPIS listens on port 8080.

LAPIS provides the following optional parameters:

-   `--lapis.docs.url`:
    If set, the landing page (`/`) will show a "Documentation" link to the provided value.
    It is meant to point to your self-hosted version of this LAPIS documentation.
    If not set, the "Documentation" link on the landing page (`/`) will not be shown.

#### Starting LAPIS with Docker

We provide Docker images for LAPIS with the name: `ghcr.io/genspectrum/lapis`.

The provided Docker images already contain reasonable default values for

-   the `lapis.databaseConfig.path` parameter: `/workspace/database_config.yaml`,
-   the `REFERENCE_GENOME_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME` environment variable: `/workspace/reference_genomes.json`.

:::note
You simply need to mount the config files to those locations in the container
and start the container with `--silo.url=<your SILO URL>`.
