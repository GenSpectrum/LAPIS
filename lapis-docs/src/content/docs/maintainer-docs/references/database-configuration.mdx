LAPIS and SILO need a `database_config.yaml`.
It's main purpose is to define the database schema for the sequence metadata.
See the [tutorial](../tutorials/start-lapis-and-silo#writing-configuration) for an example,
or use our [config generator](../tutorials/generate-your-config) to generate your own config.
More examples can be found in our tests.

The database config is considered static configuration that doesn't change with data updates.
This page contains the technical specification of the database config.

## The Schema Object

The `database_config.yaml` must contain a `schema` object on top level.
It permits the following fields:

| Key           | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| instanceName  | string | true     | The name assigned to the instance. Only used for diplay purposes.                                     |
| metadata      | array  | true     | A list of [metadata objects](#the-metadata-object) that is available on the underlying sequence data. |
| opennessLevel | enum   | true     | Possible values: `OPEN`. To be extended in the future.                                                |
| primaryKey    | string | true     | The field that serves as the primary key in SILO for the data.                                        |
| dateToSortBy  | string | false    | The field used to sort the data by date. Queries on this column will be faster.                       |
| partitionBy   | string | false    | The field used to partition the data. Used by SILO for overall query optimization.                    |
| features      | array  | false    | A list of [feature objects](#features).                                                               |

:::tip
If you have a pango lineage column in your metadata, make use of the `partitionBy` feature.
SILO will partition the data according to the lineage, which will speed up queries,
since querying can be parallelized.
:::

:::tip
If you anticipate that users will query for a certain date column more often,
it will be beneficial to set `dateToSortBy` to that column.

## The Metadata Object

The metadata object permits the following fields:

| Key                    | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name                   | string  | true     | The name of the metadata field.                                                                               |
| type                   | enum    | true     | The [type of the metadata](#metadata-types).                                                                  |
| generateIndex          | boolean | false    | See [Generating an index](#generating-an-index) below                                                         |
| lapisAllowsRegexSearch | boolean | false    | If true, LAPIS will autogenerate a filter `${name}.regex`. See [String search](../../concepts/string-search). |

:::caution
The `name` must not contain the reserved character `.`.

LAPIS uses `.` internally to generate new filters, such as the `$name.regex` filter.
To avoid conflicts, the `name` must not contain reserved characters.

### Metadata Types

<MetadataTypesList />

##### Generating an Index

Columns of type `string` support generating an index.
For columns of type `pango_lineage`, an index is always generated.
SILO internally stores precomputed bitmaps for those columns so that a query on that column becomes a trivial lookup.

:::tip
Generating an index makes most sense for columns with many equal values,
since it increases the compression ratio and thus decreases memory consumption of SILO.

## Features

The feature object permits the following fields:

| Key  | Type   | Required | Description              |
| ---- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------ |
| name | string | true     | The name of the feature. |

Currently, we support the `sarsCoV2VariantQuery` as well as the `generalizedAdvancedQuery` feature.
The `sarsCoV2VariantQuery` is a specialized query language for SARS-CoV-2 instances (see [variant queries](../../concepts/variant-query)), while the `generalizedAdvancedQuery` feature can be used for all instances (see [advanced queries](../../concepts/advanced-query)).
