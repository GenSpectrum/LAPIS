import CacheSizeEndpointLink from '../../../../components/CacheSizeEndpointLink.astro';

LAPIS uses Spring Boot's caching capabilities to cache aggregated, insertion and mutation queries.
We decided to cache SILO actions that are relatively expensive to compute,
but don't return much data (measured in size of the response body).

Details and FASTA actions are expensive, but return potentially large amounts of data.

LAPIS offers an endpoint to check the current cache size (in number of cached entries) at `/actuator/metrics/cache.size`:

<CacheSizeEndpointLink />
