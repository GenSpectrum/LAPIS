LAPIS supports queries via GET and POST requests. GET requests encode the query in the URL, offering a simple, shareable
format ideal for direct browser access. Most features are supported with GET requests. POST requests requires formatting
the query as a JSON and send it in the request body. They support a few advanced queries that are not possible with GET
requests. They are ideal if you want to make requests programmatically.

## Example

As an example, let's query the number of sequences per country and date from Africa and receive the data as a CSV file.
Hereby, we have to use the `/sample/aggregated` and set the `region` parameter to "Africa",
the `fields` parameter to "country" and "date",
and the `dataFormat` parameter to "csv".
With GET, multiple values for one parameter are separated by comma.
The query URL looks as follows, and you can open it in your browser:

```
[URL to LAPIS instance]/sample/aggregated?fields=country,date&region=Africa&dataFormat=tsv
```

Using POST, we have to write the query as a JSON:

```json
{
    "fields": ["country", "date"],
    "region": "Africa",
    "dataFormat": "csv"
}
```

The JSON will be sent to `/sample/aggregated` and the `Content-Type`-header must be set to `application/json`. Here are
example code for doing it with curl and from R and Python:

<TabsBox>
    <Tab label='curl'>
    ```bash
    curl -X POST [URL to LAPIS instance]/sample/aggregated \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"fields":["country", "date"],"region":"Africa","dataFormat":"csv"}'
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label='R'>
      TODO R code
    </Tab>
  <Tab label='Python'>
    TODO Python code
  </Tab>
</TabsBox>

:::note
This is a general example and will only work on instances that have the fields `region`, `country`, and `date`.
Check out the [fields](../references/fields) and [filters](../references/filters) page to see information about this instance.

## URL Encoded Form Data

LAPIS also supports [URL encoded form data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) for POST requests.
The content type must be set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and the query must be encoded as a query string.

Note that arrays must be passed as repeated keys, e.g. `fields=country&fields=date`.

:::tip
This is useful if you want to send the query directly from a HTML form.
If `<form>` element has the `method` attribute set to `POST`
and the `enctype` attribute set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (which is the default value),
then the `<form>` element will send the data as URL encoded form data.
