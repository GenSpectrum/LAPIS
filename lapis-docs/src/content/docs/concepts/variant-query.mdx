LAPIS offers a special query language to specify variants. A variant query can be used to filter sequences and be passed
to the server through the query parameter `variantQuery`. It is not allowed to use the `variantQuery` parameter
alongside other variant-defining parameters (e.g., `pangoLineage` or `aaMutations`). Don't forget to encode/escape the
query correctly (in JavaScript, this can be done with the
[encodeURIComponent()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent)
function)!

The formal specification of the query language is available
[here](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS/blob/main/lapis/src/main/antlr/org/genspectrum/lapis/model/variantqueryparser/VariantQuery.g4)
as an ANTLR v4 grammar.
In following, we provide an informal description and examples.
The respective
[unit test](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS/blob/main/lapis/src/test/kotlin/org/genspectrum/lapis/model/VariantQueryFacadeTest.kt)
provides a full list of possible atomic queries.

The query language understands Boolean logic. Expressions can be connected with `&` (and), `|` (or) and `!` (not).
Parentheses `(` and `)` can be used to define the order of the operations. Further, there is a special syntax to match
sequences for which at least or exactly `n` out of a list of expressions are fulfilled.

## Examples

Get the sequences with the nucleotide mutation 300G, without a deletion at position 400 and either the AA change S:123T
or the AA change S:234A:

```
300G & !400- & (S:123T | S:234A)
```

Get the sequences with at least 3 out of five mutations/deletions:

```
[3-of: 123A, 234T, S:345-, ORF1a:456K, ORF7:567-]
```

Get the sequences that fulfill exactly 2 out of 4 conditions:

```
[exactly-2-of: 123A & 234T, !234T, S:345- | S:346-, [2-of: 222T, 333G, 444A, 555C]]
```

For SARS-CoV-2, it is also possible to use [Pango lineage queries](../concepts/pango-lineage-query) (either called by pangolin
or by Nextclade) and filter by Nextstrain clades:

```
BA.5* | nextcladePangoLineage:BA.5* | nextstrainClade:22B
```

LAPIS supports a ternary logic to query [ambiguous nucleotide symbols](../concepts/ambiguous-symbols).

```
MAYBE(123W)
```
