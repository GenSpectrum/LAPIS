<Aside type='note' title='TLDR'>
    Advanced queries can be used to __filter sequences and metadata__ and can be passed to the server through the
    __query parameter `advancedQuery`__. Compared to standard filters, advanced queries allow for __more complex
    combinations of filters__.
</Aside>

Advanced queries should allow an arbitrary combination of filters. Standard LAPIS filters take the form
`filter1 AND filter2 AND ... filterN` but they cannot query for more custom cases such as `filter1 OR (filter2 AND NOT filter3)`,
the advanced queries feature allows such combinations and the creation of more custom queries.

The formal specification of the query language is available
[here](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS/blob/main/lapis/src/main/antlr/org/genspectrum/lapis/model/advancedqueryparser/AdvancedQuery.g4)
as an ANTLR v4 grammar.
In following, we provide an informal description and examples.
The respective
[unit test](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS/blob/main/lapis/src/test/kotlin/org/genspectrum/lapis/model/AdvancedQueryFacadeTest.kt)
provides a full list of possible atomic queries.

:::tip
For those readers familiar with the [CoV-Spectrum variant query](../concepts/variant-query) feature, advanced queries can be
seen a superset of variant queries, in which not only variant information can be queried but also metadata information.
:::

## Features

Advanced queries are case-insensitive. All operators and field names can be written in upper or lower case.
Only the values of metadata fields are case-sensitive.

### Variant Queries

We support mutation and insertion queries for both nucleotide and amino acid sequences, see the [mutation filter](../concepts/mutation-filters)
page for more details. Note the addition of the `MAYBE` operator to query [ambiguous nucleotide symbols](../concepts/ambiguous-symbols).

### Metadata Queries

Standard metadata queries take the form `metadataField=query`, for example

```
country=Ghana
```

Note that if the metadata field does not only contain letters and numbers it must be enclosed in single quotes, for example

```
country='United States of America'
```

To search for empty fields (fields that are `null`) use the `IsNull` operator:

```
IsNull(host)
```

For dates and numbers (int or float) we allow queries for ranges, using the `>=` and `<=` operators, for example:

```
date>=2021-01-01
```

```
date<=2021-12-31
```

For string fields we also allow regex search. To use the regex substring search on a metadata string field you must append `.regex` to the end of the metadata field name
and enclose the query in single quotes:

```
host.regex='.*bos.*'
```

For regex searches the advanced queries use the [google/re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regex syntax.

### Boolean operators

The query language understands Boolean logic. Expressions can be connected with `&` (and), `|` (or) and `!` (not).
Both `&` and `AND` are recognized as `and`, `|` and `OR` are recognized as `or`, and `!` and `NOT` are recognized as `not`.
Parentheses `(` and `)` can be used to define the order of the operations.

We also add a custom syntax `N-of` and `exactly-N-of` to match sequences for which at least or exactly `N` out of a list of expressions are fulfilled.
The syntax is as follows, where `expr1`, ..., `expr5` are any valid expressions:

```
[3-of: expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4, expr5]
```

```
[exactly-2-of: expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4]
```

## Examples

Variant queries can be sent in GET and POST requests just like standard filters.

- GET: https://lapis.cov-spectrum.org/open/v2/sample/aggregated?advancedQuery=501T%20and%20country=Switzerland

- POST:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://lapis.cov-spectrum.org/open/v2/sample/aggregated" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{"advancedQuery": "501T and country=Switzerland"}'
    ```

Some example queries that can be plugged into the `advancedQuery` parameter:

- Get the sequences with the nucleotide mutation 300G, without a deletion at position 400 and either the AA change S:123T
  or the AA change S:234A:

    ```
    300G & !400- & (S:123T | S:234A)
    ```

    This can also be written as

    ```
    300G AND NOT 400- AND (S:123T OR S:234A)
    ```

- Get all sequences from the USA that do not have cows as a host and that also have the mutation 300G:

    ```
    NOT host='bos taurus' AND 300G AND country=USA
    ```

- Get the sequences with at least 3 out of five mutations/deletions:

    ```
    [3-of: 123A, 234T, S:345-, ORF1a:456K, ORF7A:100-]
    ```

- Get the sequences that fulfill exactly 2 out of 4 conditions:

    ```
    [exactly-2-of: 123A & 234T, !234T, S:345- | S:346-, [2-of: 222T, 333G, 444A, 555C]]
    ```

:::note
Don't forget to encode/escape the query correctly. In JavaScript, this can be done with the
[encodeURIComponent()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent)
function.
