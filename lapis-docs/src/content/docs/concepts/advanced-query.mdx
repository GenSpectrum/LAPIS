For those readers familiar with cov-spectrum's [variant query](../concepts/variant-query) feature advanced queries can be
seen a superset of variant queries, in which not only variant information can be queried but also metadata information.

Advanced queries can be used to filter sequences and metadata and can be passed to the server through the query parameter
`advancedQuery`. Don't forget to encode/escape the query correctly (in JavaScript, this can be done with the
[encodeURIComponent()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent)
function)!

The formal specification of the query language is available
[here](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS/blob/main/lapis/src/main/antlr/org/genspectrum/lapis/model/advancedqueryparser/AdvancedQuery.g4)
as an ANTLR v4 grammar.
In following, we provide an informal description and examples.
The respective
[unit test](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS/blob/main/lapis/src/test/kotlin/org/genspectrum/lapis/model/AdvancedQueryFacadeTest.kt)
provides a full list of possible atomic queries.

The query language understands Boolean logic. Expressions can be connected with `&` (and), `|` (or) and `!` (not).
Both `&` and `AND` are recognized as `and`, `|` and `OR` are recognized as `or`, and `!` and `NOT` are recognized as `not`.
Parentheses `(` and `)` can be used to define the order of the operations. Further, there is a special syntax to match
sequences for which at least or exactly `n` out of a list of expressions are fulfilled. For variants we additionally add
the `MAYBE` operator to query [ambiguous nucleotide symbols](../concepts/ambiguous-symbols).

For metadata fields we also add custom queries to allow for regex substring search, is null queries (to search for fields
which are empty or `null`) as well as range queries for dates and numbers.

## Examples

Get the sequences with the nucleotide mutation 300G, without a deletion at position 400 and either the AA change S:123T
or the AA change S:234A:

```
300G & !400- & (S:123T | S:234A)
```

This can also be written as

```
300G AND NOT 400- AND (S:123T OR S:234A)
```

Get the sequences with at least 3 out of five mutations/deletions:

```
[3-of: 123A, 234T, S:345-, ORF1a:456K, ORF7A:100-]
```

Get the sequences that fulfill exactly 2 out of 4 conditions:

```
[exactly-2-of: 123A & 234T, !234T, S:345- | S:346-, [2-of: 222T, 333G, 444A, 555C]]
```

Get sequences that might have the mutation 123W (this includes ambiguous symbols and `N`):

```
MAYBE(123W)
```

We can also add metadata queries to the advanced query.

For example, to get all sequences from the USA that do not have cows as a host and that also have the mutation 300G:

```
NOT host='bos taurus' AND 300G AND country=USA
```

Note that if the metadata field does not only contain letters and numbers (e.g. it contains a space or a regex),
it must be enclosed in single quotes.

!! When passing single quotes in curl they must be escaped correctly, for example the statement:

```
{
  "advancedQuery": "country.regex='Basel{1,2}'"
}
```

Must be formatted as:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://localhost:8096/sample/details' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "advancedQuery": "country.regex='\''Basel\{1,2\}'\''"
}'
```

If the metadata field contains a single quote, it must be escaped with a backslash.

To use the regex substring search on a metadata field you must append `.regex` to the end of the metadata field name:

```
host.regex='.*bos.*'
```

To search for empty fields (fields that are `null` or empty) use the `IS NULL` operator:

```
IsNull(host)
```

For dates and numbers (int or float) we allow queries for ranges, using the `>=` and `<=` operators:

```
date>=2021-01-01 AND date=<2021-12-31
```

Note this is equivalent to:

```
dateFrom=2021-01-01 AND dateTo=2021-12-31
```

Of course

```
date=2021-01-01
```

can still be used which is equivalent to

```
dateFrom=2021-01-01 AND dateTo=2021-01-01
```
