title: Ambiguous symbols
description: Explanation how ambiguous reads are handled in the data
---

[The symbols page](../references/nucleotide-and-amino-acid-symbols)
lists all symbols that the underlying sequence files in `.FASTA` format can contain.
The ambiguous symbols arise from imperfect reads in the sequencer.

While one mostly queries for the symbols `A`, `C`, `G`, `T` and `-` to look for specific features and mutations of a sequence,
or `N` for quality control of the underlying data,
the ambiguous symbols `R` through `V` are often too cumbersome to consider in analyses.

LAPIS supports the flexible consideration of these ambiguous symbols
through an extension of the boolean logic syntax in the variant queries.

Here we introduce a new expression `MAYBE` to consider sequences that have an ambiguous code which **maybe** matches the queried value.

#### Example

Consider the following sequences:

```
12345
AAACG
AARCG
AANCG
AAGCG
AAACG
```

A filter for the mutation `3G` returns only the sequence `AAGCG`, as it is the only sequence with the symbol `G` at position 3.
The filter `MAYBE(3G)` however also considers that the sequences `AARCG` and `AANCG` **may** have the symbol `G` at position 3,
because the symbols `R` and `N` can represent Guanine.
