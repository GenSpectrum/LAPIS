LAPIS allows users to filter string fields in the metadata using [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).
This is useful when the full string is unknown or when a more complex search is needed.

By default, the string search is disabled for all string fields. It can be enabled by the instance administrator.
A list of searchable fields of this LAPIS instance can be found [here](../references/filters).

The syntax for the string search is a subset of the syntax of the [PCRE](https://www.pcre.org/) library.
Under the hood, we use the [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2) library to evaluate the regular expressions.

## Examples

Get the number of sequences with the `division` field containing the string `Basel`:

```
GET /sample/aggregated?division.regex=Basel
```

Get the number of sequences with the `division` field starting with the string `Basel`:

```
GET /sample/aggregated?division.regex=^Basel
```
