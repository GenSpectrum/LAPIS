description: How to authenticate requests to LAPIS
---

Some LAPIS instances require authentication to access their data.
If an instance is configured with authentication, you need to include a valid access token in your requests.

## Checking if Authentication is Required

Try accessing any endpoint without authentication:

```bash
curl https://lapis.example.com/sample/info -v
```

If authentication is required, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response and the output will contains something like
```
> ...
< HTTP/1.1 401
< ...
```

If the instance is open (no authentication), you'll receive the normal response data.

## Getting an Access Token

Contact the LAPIS instance administrator to learn how to obtain an access token.
The method depends on the identity provider configured for that instance.

Common methods include:
- **Username/password** - Exchange credentials for a token
- **Client credentials** - Use a client ID and secret
- **OAuth 2.0 flows** - Authorization code, device flow, etc.

## Making Authenticated Requests

To make authenticated requests to LAPIS, include the access token in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://lapis.example.com/sample/aggregated
```
