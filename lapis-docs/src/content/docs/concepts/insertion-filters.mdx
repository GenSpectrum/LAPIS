It is possible to filter for amino acid and nucleotide insertions.
Multiple insertion filters can be provided in a single request.

A nucleotide insertion has the format <NucleotideInsertion /> <SegmentNames/>
A `<insertion>` can be a string of one or more of the four nucleotides `A`, `T`, `C`, `G` or the [ambiguous symbols](../concepts/ambiguous-symbols).
**Example:** <NucleotideInsertionExample/>

An amino acid insertion has the format `ins_<gene>:<position>:<insertions>`. <GeneNames />
A `<insertions>` can be a string of one or more of the 20 amino acid codes, or [ambiguous symbols](../concepts/ambiguous-symbols).
**Example:** <AminoAcidInsertionExample/>

#### Wildcard

Both insertion filters support a search if the insertion is not known (entirely).
In the insertion you can add `?` at a position, where you expect any or multiple insertions.

**Examples:**

- `ins_S:123:?TA?` will match any insertion, at position 123 on gene S that has an insertion that contains the symbols `TA`.
- `ins_S:123:?` will match any insertion, at position 123 on gene S
