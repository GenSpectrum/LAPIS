title: Architecture and Constraints
description: Overview of the architecture and constraints of the software.
---

We identified the following constraints for our software:

- Developed under an **open-source** licence.
  We chose the tooling such that a broad spectrum of developers can in principle work on the software.
- The software is designed to be **highly configurable** so that it can be used for various organisms.
  Configuration files have to be passed to LAPIS and SILO at runtime that determine the nature of the organism such as:
    - a reference genome
    - which metadata is available on the genomic data
- The system is designed to have the best possible **performance**.
  This mostly targets SILO, but also in LAPIS,
  we have to keep in mind that we are dealing with potentially large data that we have to serve to the client.
