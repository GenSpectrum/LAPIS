This tutorial will guide you through the process of plotting the global distribution of all sequences in R by fetching data from the open SARS-CoV-2 LAPIS API of CoV-Spectrum. It is able to aggregate data. You will learn how to query the API, check for errors and deprecation, parse data as a data frame, and create a plot using the ggplot2 package.

## Prerequisites

You should have a basic understanding of R programming and the ggplot2 package.

## Step 1: Query data from the LAPIS API

First, you will use the `fromJSON` function from the jsonlite package to query the LAPIS API:

```r
library(jsonlite)
response <- fromJSON("https://lapis.cov-spectrum.org/open/sample/aggregated?fields=region")
```

The URL used in the query is structured as follows:

- `https://lapis.cov-spectrum.org/open`: This is the base URL for the LAPIS instance.
- `/sample/aggregated`: This endpoint retrieves aggregated data
- `?fields=region`: This query parameter specifies that we want to aggregate the data by the `region` field.

By querying this URL, you fetch the aggregated data on sequences stratified by their regions.

## Step 2: Check for errors

Before proceeding, it's important to check if there are any errors in the API response:

```r
errors <- response$errors
if (length(errors) > 0) {
  stop("Errors")
}
```

If there are errors, the program will stop with an error message.

## Step 3: Parse data from JSON as a data frame

Now that you have verified the API response, you can parse the data into a data frame:

```r
data <- response$data
```

## Step 4: Create a plot using ggplot2

Finally, you will use the ggplot2 package to create a polar bar plot of the global distribution of sequences by region:

```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(
  data,
  aes(x = "", y = count, fill = region)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid=element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

This will generate a polar bar plot displaying the global distribution of all sequences by region.
